# VectorNeuralNets

An vector/matrix based implementation  of a simple multi-layered neural network and stochastic gradient descent
for learning, using back-propagation. Also added some fancier nodifications to the simple gradient descent learner.

Mainly this is for getting more familiar with the core implementation of a neural net.

Dependencies:
C++11/14
